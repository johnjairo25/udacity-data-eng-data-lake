# Data Lake Project Using Spark

This repository contains the solution to the Data Lake Project of the 
Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree.   

The project moves the data from `json` files to `parquet` files. The 
representation is changed in order to improve the query performance.
The data transformation process is carried out using `spark`.   

##Â Files in the project

- `dl.cfg`: Example configuration file.
- `etl.py`: ETL pipeline process using PySpark SQL.

## Running the project

Execute the `etl.py` file.   

```python
python etl.py
```
